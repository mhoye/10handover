# Ten Simple Rules for Handing Over and Moving On

This advice is for founders who are handing on their projects.

1.  **Be sure you mean it.**
    Letting go will be hard on you,
    but not letting go will be even harder on your successors,
    so be sure you're actually going to let go.

2.  **Do it when other people think you should.**
    Just as you are the last person to realize when you're too tired to be coding,
    you will often be the last person to realize that you ought to be moving on,
    so ask people
    and pay attention to what they say.

3.  **Don't choose your successor on your own.**
    You may have strong opinions about who should succeed you,
    but you should still check those opinions with someone more objective.

5.  **Train.**
    Share tasks with your successor for a few days or weeks:
    they will get to see how things actually work,
    and you'll discover things you would otherwise forget to tell them.

5.  **Practice.**
    Go on holiday for a week and leave your successor temporarily in charge.
    You'll discover even more things you would otherwise forget to pass on.

6.  **No secrets.**
    Tell people that you're leaving and what the succession plan is
    as soon as possible
    (which in practice means
    "as soon as there is little chance of having to revise what you have said publicly").

8.  **No backchannels.**
    The decisions, and consequences, belong to your successor.
    Advise them in private; support them in public.
    Do not undermine the credibility you've granted them.

9.  **Leave.**
    It may be tempting to continue to have a role in the organization,
    but that usually leads to confusion,
    since people are used to looking to you for answers.
    It will be easier for your successor,
    particularly if they weren't a founder as well,
    but the best thing you can do to help them is to find something else to do for a year.

10. **Don't look back.**
