1.  **Be sure you mean it.**
    Letting go will be hard on you,
    but not letting go will be even harder on your successors,
    so be sure you're actually going to let go.

2.  **Do it when other people think you should.**
    Just as you are the last person to realize when you're too tired to be coding,
    you will often be the last person to realize that you ought to be moving on,
    so ask people
    and pay attention to what they say.

3.  **Don't choose your successor on your own.**
    You may have strong opinions about who should succeed you,
    but you should still check those opinions with someone more objective.

5.  **Train.**
    Share tasks with your successor for a few days or weeks:
    they will get to see how things actually work,
    and you'll discover things you would otherwise forget to tell them.

5.  **Practice.**
    Go on holiday for a week and leave your successor temporarily in charge.
    You'll discover even more things you would otherwise forget to pass on.

6.  **Give them room.**
    Ex-presidents move out of Washington for good reasons.
